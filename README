this is the start of a project that will
combine GTD (Getting Things Done) with collobaration 
and project management tools.
It will add Communication (Comments, Conversations)
and Files as well as Statistics.
The user in the end should be either companies
working in teams or even private groups organising
concerts, parties or whatever.

The base for the project should be either Zend_Framework 
or Symphony.

The only author so far is me, ansgar
